#**app-stl-viewer**
STL Viewer is an node.js application for downloading and viewing the contents of Stereo Lithography files. STL files are representations of the surfaces of solid models that have been created in Onshape. STL files are a neutral format that can easily be generated by almost all CAD systems.

####**Running Locally**
Make sure you have Node.js and the Heroku Toolbelt installed.

    $ git clone https://github.com/onshape/app-stl-viewer.git
    $ cd app-stl-viewer
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    
You now have a functioning git repository that contains STL viewer application as well as package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

Your app should now be running on localhost:7000.

####**Deploying to Heroku**
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

    $ heroku create
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku open
